The Wuhan strain has been identified as a new strain of Betacoronavirus from group 2B with approximately 70% genetic similarity to the SARS-CoV. The virus has a 96% similarity to a bat coronavirus, so it is widely suspected to originate from bats as well.\n",

        "The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). More than 34.9 million confirmed cases have been reported since January 2020, resulting in more than 613,000 deaths, the most of any country, and the twenty-second-highest per capita worldwide. As many infections have gone undetected, the Centers for Disease Control estimated that, as of March 2021, there are a total 114.6 million infections in the United States, or more than a third of the total population. The U.S. has about one-fifth of the world's confirmed cases and deaths. COVID-19 became the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. U.S. life expectancy dropped 3 years for Hispanic Americans, 2.9 years for African Americans, and 1.2 years for white Americans from 2019 to 2020.\n",

The FDA granted emergency use authorization to the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine on December 10, 2020; mass vaccinations began on December 14, 2020. The Moderna vaccine was granted emergency use authorization on December 17, 2020, and the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine was granted emergency use authorization on February 27, 2021. By April 19, 2021, all U.S. states had opened vaccine eligibility to residents aged 16 and over. On May 10, 2021, the FDA approved the Pfizer vaccine for adolescents aged 12 to 15.\n",

        "By July 4, 2021, 67% of the United States' adult population had received at least one dose, just short of a goal of 70%. While vaccines have helped to significantly reduce the number of daily COVID-19 infections nationwide, there are still a number of states where vaccination rates are below average, which have seen increasing numbers of cases credited to the highly-infectious Delta variant.\n",
